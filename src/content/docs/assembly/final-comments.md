## Test Your Configuration
- Please test your XFAVR setup after finishing the assembly process to ensure everything works as expected. It is very possible that you missed an important connection during assembly. The last thing you want is to hot glue all of the components down and realize that a wire is in the wrong place, or not there at all!

## Hot Glue Your Components
- After you confirm that the XFAVR device works as expected, go ahead and hot glue the components down. This includes all wires, all components inside of the microcontroller case, and the components that are on the lid (keypad, OLED screen, etc).

## After Assembly
- Once assembled, head on to the [Quick Start](/operation/quick-start/) page to learn how to operate the XFAVR device.
